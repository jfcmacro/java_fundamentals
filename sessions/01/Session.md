## Object-Oriented Thinking - Interview Advice

> Common questions: **What is ...?**

> The correct answer are a combination of technical knowledge and real-world analogies or examples.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Object

* An object is one the core concepts of OOP.
* An object is real-world entity.
* An object has state (fields) and behaviours  (methods).
* An object represent an instance of a class.
* An object takes up some space in memory.
* An object can communicate with other objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Class

* A class is one the core concepts of OOP.
* A class is a template or a blueprint for creating objects.
* A class doesn't consume memory.
* A class can be instantiated multiple times.
* A class does one, and only one thing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Abstraction

* A class is one the core concepts of OOP.
* Abstraction is the concept of exposing to the user only those things that are revelant to them and hinding the remainder of the details.
* Abstraction allows the user to focus on what the application does instead of how it does it.
* Abstraction is achieved in some languages via abstract classes and interfac

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Encapsulation

  * Encapsulation is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Encapsulation is a technique whereby the object state is hidden from the outer world and a set of public methods for accessing this state are exposed.
  * Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class.
  * Encapsulation is known as the **data-hiding** mecanism.
  * Encapsulation has a number of important advantages associated with it, such as loosely coupled, reusable, secure and easy-to-test code.
  * In Java (for instance) , encapsulation is implemented via the access modifiers . `private`, `public`, `protected`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Inheritance ##

  * Inheritance is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Inheritance allows an object to be based on another object.
  * Inheritance sustains code reusability by allowing an object to reuse the code of another object and add its own logic as well.
  * Inheritance is know as an **IS-A** relationship, also referenced as a parent-child relationship.
  * In Python, inheritance is achive via a list parameter in the class definition.
  * The inherited object is referenced as the superclass, and the object that inherites the superclass is reference as the superclass.
  * In Python, multiple inheritance is allowed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Polymorphism ##

  * Polymorphism is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Polymorphism means *many forms* in Greek.
  * Polymorphism allows an object to behave differently in certain cases.
  * Polymorphism can be shaped via method overloading or via method overriding in the case of an IS-A relationship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Association ##

  * Association is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Association defines the relation between two classes that are independent of another.
  * Association has no owner.
  * Association cab be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Aggregation ##

  * Aggregation is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Aggregation is a special cases of unidirectional association.
  * Aggregation represente a **HAS-A** relationship.
  * Two aggregated objects have their own life cycle, but one of the objects is the owner of the HAS-A relationship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Object-Oriented Thinking - Composition ##

  * Composition is one the core concepts of OOP.
  * Composition is a more restrictive case of aggregation.
  * Composition represent a **HAS-A** relationship that contains an object that cannot exits on its own.
  * Composition sustains code reuse and the visibility control of objects.

## Object-Oriented Thinking Project (3)

*Please read carefully and do the following:*

1. Describe the requirements for the chosen system: functional and non-functional.
2. Design use cases for the system based on the requirements.
3. Identify objects, classes, and relationships in the system. Optionally, design CRC cards.
4. Design class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system.
5. Optionally, convert diagrams into Java code.
6. Send the following results: requirements, use cases, CRCs (optional), class diagrams, Java code of the classes.

# SOLID

---

## SOLID

  * S: Single Responsibility Principle
  * O: Open Closed Principle
  * L: Liskov's Substitution Principle
  * I: Interface Segregation Principle
  * D: Dependency Inversion Principle


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SOLID - S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

  * S stands for the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
  * S stands for One class should have one, and only one, responsibility.
  * S tells us to write a class for only one goal.
  * S sustains high maintainability and visibility control across the application modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SOLID - O: Open Closed Principle (OCP)

  * O stands for the Open Closed Principle (OCP).
  * O stands for Software components should be open for extension,
    but closed for modification.
  * O sustains the fact that our classes should not contain constraints
    that will require other developers to modify our classes in order
    to accomplish their job – other developers should only
    extend our classes to accomplish their job.
  * O sustains software extensibility in a versatile, intuitive, and
    non-harmful way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SOLID - L: Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP)

  * L stands for Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP).
  * L stands for Derived types must be completely substitutable
    for their base types.
  * L sustains the fact that objects of subclasses must behave
    in the same way as the objects of superclasses.
  * L is useful for runtime-type identification followed by the cast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SOLID - I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

  * I stands for the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
  * I stands for Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary
    methods that they will not use.
  * I splits an interface into two or more interfaces until clients
    are not forced to implement methods that they will not use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SOLID - D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

  * D stands for the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
  * D stands for Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
  * D sustains the use of abstract layers to bind concrete
    modules together instead of having concrete modules that
    depend on other concrete modules.
  * D sustains the decoupling of concrete modules.
